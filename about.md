# FAQ


## Why no official `.mcfunction` support?
> This project is extremely complex and volatile as is. I personally never use `.mcfunction` in favor of `.bolt` files as they're more predictable and let you precisely dictate the compiletime load order.

## Why my compile times slower?
> The first run may take a long time, since beet has to cache minecraft's vanilla data. But overall compile times will be slightly longer since Reaper does a ton of things behind the scenes.


# Future of the project

All though this is more of a proof-of-concept than anything, I'll still try my best to bugfix.

Some things while fully usable, aren't perfect. I'm no python wizard or 10x dev, just a guy who had an idea and gave it his all. Contributing is very much appreciated (all though I'd have out how to use that feature), but I feel like a refactor by an actual skilled python developer is hands down best thing to make this thing better. I'm not skilled enough to do that as of now.


# Personal note

This is a solo project as of me writing this. I once thought most of what it currently has is not physically possible to accomplish.

I'm happily surprised that I proved myself wrong there.
I've always been a guy who tries to push the boundaries and reimagine what is possible and what isn't by thinking outside the box.

My goal is to create stuff people will appreciate and find useful. The feeling of my work having a positive impact on other people is nothing short of incredible.

This project alone took me more than 800 hours excluding learning bolt which is a few thousand hours at this point as well as years of minecraft scripting experience. Sorry if the code isn't up to professional python dev standards, I learned python from nothing using this project.


Huge thanks to the awesome Beet community for always being helpful, patient and wholesome. Especially the Beet Discord server where a lot of the creative ideas and impossible solutions came from.

As well as you, the reader or developer for listening to my message or hopefully utilizing it to create more wonderful things.


You can contact me by adding me on discord and striking me a dm `Yeti#0231`.

Thank you, Yeti.
